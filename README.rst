Object storage for Open edX: pick a backend, not a plugin
===========================================================

This is a plugin for `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.edly.io>`_ that configures Open
edX's object storage. One config key, ``OBJSTORAGE_BACKEND``, picks which of
three backends actually runs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - You want
     - Set ``OBJSTORAGE_BACKEND`` to
   * - An S3 server on your own hardware, alongside Open edX (the default)
     - ``rustfs``
   * - Azure Blob Storage — **read the warning below first**
     - ``azure``
   * - AWS S3, GCS, Ceph, DigitalOcean Spaces, or any other S3-compatible
       provider (including a RustFS/MinIO instance on a separate machine)
     - ``external_s3``

This plugin supersedes two previous, separately-released plugins,
``tutor-rustfs`` and ``tutor-rclone-gateway`` — see `MIGRATING.rst
<MIGRATING.rst>`_ if you're coming from either of those. It is **not**
affiliated with `tutor-contrib-s3 <https://github.com/cleura/tutor-contrib-s3>`_,
an independently maintained plugin; the ``external_s3`` backend here
reimplements equivalent functionality so this plugin can be a complete,
standalone choice, but that project continues to exist on its own and is not
replaced or depended upon by this one.



   **The ``azure`` backend is not safe for production course content yet.**

   This plugin's own live conformance suite reproducibly hangs ``rclone serve
   s3`` when multipart upload parts arrive out of ascending order.

   Read `EVALUATION.md <EVALUATION.md>`_ before using this backend for anything
   beyond evaluation.





How it works
------------

Whichever backend you pick, Open edX keeps talking to one plain S3 endpoint —
nothing in Django or Studio changes based on ``OBJSTORAGE_BACKEND``. What sits
behind that endpoint differs entirely by backend:

- ``rustfs`` runs `RustFS <https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs>`_, a native
  S3-compatible storage *engine*, as a container alongside Open edX, with its
  own data volume and web console.
- ``azure`` runs two `rclone <https://rclone.org>`_ ``serve s3`` processes (one
  authenticated, one anonymous-read-only) as a *translation layer* in front of
  an Azure Blob Storage account — see `EVALUATION.md <EVALUATION.md>`_ for why
  two processes and the full architectural reasoning.
- ``external_s3`` runs **no local infrastructure at all**. Open edX's S3
  client is pointed directly at your own externally-managed bucket(s); this
  plugin only renders Django settings, nothing else.

Selecting a backend you aren't using costs nothing: that backend's
compose/Kubernetes resources, Caddy routing, and init-task logic simply don't
render. Enabling more than one object-storage plugin (``tutor-minio``, or this
plugin's own predecessors ``tutor-rustfs``/``tutor-rclone-gateway``, or
``tutor-contrib-s3``) raises an error, since they'd collide on the same Open
edX settings.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install tutor-objectstorage
    tutor plugins enable objectstorage

With no further configuration, this reproduces a zero-account ``rustfs``
deployment — ``tutor local launch`` works immediately, the same experience
``tutor-rustfs`` gave on its own.

Testing without external accounts
----------------------------------

The ``rustfs`` backend needs no external account by definition. The ``azure``
backend defaults to `Azurite <https://github.com/Azure/Azurite>`_, Microsoft's
own free local Azure Storage emulator, so it can be evaluated without a real
Azure subscription either (besides the risk acknowledgment above). The
``external_s3`` backend has no local-emulator option — it is, by definition,
pointed at a real external account.

Configuration
--------------

Shared across all three backends:

- ``OBJSTORAGE_BACKEND`` (default: ``"rustfs"``) — ``rustfs``, ``azure``, or
  ``external_s3``.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"openedx"``) — also the one bucket
  that is anonymously readable, on the backends that support that
  distinction.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_FILE_UPLOAD_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"openedxuploads"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_VIDEO_UPLOAD_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"openedxvideos"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_GRADES_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"openedxgrades"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_OPENEDX_LEARNING_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"openedxlearning"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_DISCOVERY_BUCKET_NAME`` (default: ``"discoveryuploads"`` when
  the ``discovery`` plugin is enabled, otherwise empty) — also anonymously
  readable, for the same reason as the main bucket.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_QUERYSTRING_AUTH`` (default: ``true``)
- ``OPENEDX_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`` / ``OPENEDX_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` — Tutor-core
  settings this plugin wires up automatically for ``rustfs``/``azure``
  (generated, random secret); for ``external_s3`` you set these two yourself.

``rustfs`` backend:

- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_HOST`` (default: ``"files.{{ LMS_HOST }}"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_CONSOLE_HOST`` (default: ``"rustfs.{{ LMS_HOST }}"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_REGION`` (default: ``"us-east-1"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_DOCKER_IMAGE`` (default:
  ``"docker.io/rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_RC_DOCKER_IMAGE`` (default:
  ``"docker.io/rustfs/rc:v0.1.36"``) — the init/admin client image.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_UID`` / ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_GID`` (both default:
  ``10001``)

RustFS runs as a non-root user and stores data on a bind-mounted volume. On a
fresh Linux install, create the data directory with the right owner *before*
the first ``tutor local start``::

    mkdir -p "$(tutor config printroot)/data/rustfs"
    sudo chown -R 10001:10001 "$(tutor config printroot)/data/rustfs"

(Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows maps bind-mount ownership to the host user,
so this only bites on native Linux — i.e. most production hosts. Kubernetes
handles this automatically via ``fsGroup``.)

``azure`` backend:

- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_ACKNOWLEDGE_RISK`` (default: ``false``) — **required**
  to be ``true`` before any Azure infrastructure renders. See the warning
  above and `EVALUATION.md <EVALUATION.md>`_.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_HOST`` (default: ``"files.{{ LMS_HOST }}"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_REGION`` (default: ``"us-east-1"``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_DOCKER_IMAGE`` (default:
  ``"docker.io/rclone/rclone:1.75.1"``) — **hard-pinned to an exact tag.**
  1.75.1 fixes CVE-2026-88045, an unauthenticated memory-exhaustion
  denial-of-service in rclone's multipart upload path — never go below it.
  If you bump this, re-run the live conformance suite against the new tag
  first.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_UID`` / ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_GID`` (both default: ``1009``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT`` / ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY`` /
  ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_ENDPOINT`` — default to Azurite's fixed, publicly
  documented, non-secret values. To use a real Azure Storage account, override
  all three together (``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_ENDPOINT`` e.g.
  ``https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net``).
- ``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_AZURITE_DOCKER_IMAGE`` (default:
  ``"mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite:3.37.0"``)

There is no console setting for this backend: rclone has no web console or
bucket browser. Use the Azure Portal, Azure Storage Explorer, or
``rclone ncdu`` against the same ``azureblob:`` remote instead.

``external_s3`` backend:

- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_ENDPOINT_HOST`` / ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_PORT``
  (both default: ``""``) — leave empty for real AWS S3; set both for any
  other S3-compatible provider.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_REGION`` (default: ``""``) — required for real AWS
  S3.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_USE_SSL`` (default: ``true``)
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE`` (default: ``"auto"``) — set to
  ``"path"`` for a Ceph RGW endpoint without ``rgw_dns_name`` configured.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`` (default: ``""``) — do not set this
  for real AWS S3.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_PROFILE_IMAGE_BUCKET`` (default:
  ``"{{ OBJSTORAGE_BUCKET_NAME }}"``) — set to ``""`` to keep profile images
  on local filesystem instead of object storage.
- ``OBJSTORAGE_EXTERNAL_S3_PROFILE_IMAGE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`` (default: ``""``)

**This backend provisions no buckets automatically** — different providers
have genuinely different ACL/CLI semantics, so, matching how
``tutor-contrib-s3`` already works, you create and access-control every
bucket listed above yourself before enabling this plugin. ``tutor local do
init`` will print exactly which bucket names it expects.

DNS records
-----------

Whichever of ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_HOST``, ``OBJSTORAGE_RUSTFS_CONSOLE_HOST``, or
``OBJSTORAGE_AZURE_HOST`` applies to your chosen backend must resolve to your
server. ``external_s3`` has no such requirement — it talks to your provider's
own endpoint.

Kubernetes
----------

Both the ``rustfs`` and ``azure`` backends ship full Kubernetes parity
(``tutor k8s ...``). The ``azure`` backend additionally ships a
``NetworkPolicy`` restricting both its gateway Deployments to ingress from the
Caddy pod only — this is not optional hardening; see `EVALUATION.md
<EVALUATION.md>`_. The ``external_s3`` backend creates no Kubernetes resources
at all.

Testing
-------

See `TESTING.rst <TESTING.rst>`_ for the full tiered procedure, and
`EVALUATION.md <EVALUATION.md>`_ for the ``azure`` backend's live-testing
results and what they mean for whether it's a good idea for your deployment.
